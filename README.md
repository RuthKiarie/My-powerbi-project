# My-powerbi-project
Maji Ndogo Report

This is a Power BI project I did on a hypothetical country called Maji Ndogo, tackling the challenge of access to basic clean water. 
It uncovers insights and drills down into the level of inequity present in the population. I've also come up with solutions to address the needs of the population, especially the most vulnerable one.
